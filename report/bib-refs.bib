    abstract = {We introduce ChordDiagram, the first module of Custom Axes and CHarts Advanced Interface (Cachai), a fully customizable visualization toolkit for Python. ChordDiagram creates publication-ready chord diagrams with fine control over edge styles, node colors, and layout, addressing key limitations of existing tools. Features include per-element styling, correlation thresholding, targeted highlighting, adaptive node spacing, log-scaled link thickness, and more. While broadly applicable, we showcase its use in astronomy by visualizing (anti-)correlations among stellar parameters and kinematics. ChordDiagram forms the foundation of the Cachai suite, available via pip (https://pypi.org/project/cachai), and at https://github.com/DD-Beltran-F/cachai, where the user can find a detailed documentation and examples.}
